About
-----

I have written this humble guide for learning python, originally to introduce some colleagues to this wonderful tool that is Python.

As for myself, I started Python in a chaotic way; trying out some code, searching for my problems on stackoverflow, reading random articles... Since then, I have gained a bit of experience, and I start to really appreciate Python. Today, I write this as a tour guide, hoping that it will give to some happy readers an easier time than I had.

Much has already been said about Python, in a much better way that I would ever do. But it is quite challenging to find the right tutorial at the right time, deep inside the chaos of the Internet. Then, I didn't want to start this whole tutorial thing from scratch, but I also wanted to do more than just giving links away. I am happy of the result: most of the insight are into the links, and each link is wrapped with a little bit of context, still following a guideline overall.

Take your time when following this path, read slowly, even read again if you don't feel confident, and most importantly stick to your keyboard and try the code as often as you can.

If you have any question, feel free contact me. And if you want to contribute to this guide, you are more than welcome.
